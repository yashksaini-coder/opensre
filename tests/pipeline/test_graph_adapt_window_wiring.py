"""Graph-level smoke tests for the adapt_window node wiring.

The adapt_window node sits on the loop-back edge of the investigation
pipeline: ``diagnose → adapt_window → plan_actions``. Terminal paths
(``opensre_eval``, ``publish``) bypass it. These tests assert that
contract by inspecting the compiled LangGraph rather than running it.

Per-node behaviour is tested elsewhere (``tests/nodes/adapt_window/``),
and the routing function itself is tested in
``test_route_investigation_eval.py``. This file only verifies the
WIRING.

Implementation note: LangGraph's public ``get_graph().edges`` cannot
statically traverse past an ``add_conditional_edges`` call that uses
dynamic ``Send`` fan-out (``distribute_hypotheses``) — every edge after
that point is dropped from the introspection view. We therefore read
``builder.branches`` (conditional edges with their path maps) and
``builder.edges`` (unconditional edges) directly. Both are stable,
documented attributes of LangGraph's StateGraph.

# Local Setup Guide

This guide covers two local paths:

- A live local Grafana RCA demo
- The full local development flow with your Tracer account

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- `make`

## 1. Fastest path: live local Grafana RCA demo

If you want to see a minimal RCA report against a real local Grafana stack, start here.

- Docker
- Python 3.11+
- `make`

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

2. Copy the example env file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Add one LLM key to `.env`:

   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
   ```

   Or, if you prefer OpenAI:

   ```bash
   LLM_PROVIDER=openai
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

4. Run the live local Grafana RCA example:

   ```bash
   make local-grafana-live
   ```

This single command starts the local `Grafana + Loki` stack if needed, seeds failure logs into Loki, and runs the RCA demo. It still uses a synthetic alert payload and does not require a Tracer account or real Slack, Datadog, or AWS credentials.

When you are done, stop the stack:

```bash
make grafana-local-down
```

If you want a generic no-Docker bundled RCA example instead, run:

```bash
make local-rca-demo
```

## 2. Full local development setup

Use this path when you want to run the agent locally with your Tracer account and your own integrations.

### Install dependencies

```bash
make install
```

### Configure env variables

1. Copy the example env file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Add one LLM key to `.env`:

   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
   ```

   Or, if you prefer OpenAI:

   ```bash
   LLM_PROVIDER=openai
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

At this stage, only one LLM API key is mandatory. Everything else depends on which path you want to test:

- Required for any RCA run: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Required only for the `Tracer Web App path`: `JWT_TOKEN`
- Optional per system: `DD_*`, `GRAFANA_*`, `AWS_*`
- Optional only for Slack delivery: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
- Optional only for LangGraph deploy: `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`

### Choose an integration source

You can run `Flow B` in two supported ways:

- `Tracer Web App path`: use integrations already configured in Tracer and authenticate locally with `JWT_TOKEN`
- `Local config path`: store integrations in `~/.tracer/integrations.json` or define them in `.env`

Both paths are supported. During investigations, Tracer uses this priority:

1. Inbound auth token from a web request or Slack-triggered run
2. `JWT_TOKEN` for Tracer web app integrations, with `~/.tracer/integrations.json` and `.env` filling missing services
3. `~/.tracer/integrations.json`
4. `.env` fallback integrations

### Tracer Web App path

Use this path if you already configured integrations in Tracer.

1. Go to `https://app.tracer.cloud`, sign in, and create or copy your Tracer API token from settings.
2. In `.env`, set:

   ```bash
   JWT_TOKEN=your-tracer-token-from-app.tracer.cloud
   ```

3. Verify Tracer connectivity:

   ```bash
   make verify-integrations SERVICE=tracer
   ```

4. If some services are not configured in Tracer yet, you can still add them locally via `~/.tracer` or `.env` and they will be used as fallback.

### Local config path

Use this path if you want to test or build integrations without depending on the Tracer web app.

For a first real-system run, you do not need every integration:

- `Datadog` or `Grafana` is enough to prove the RCA path against a real observability source
- Add `AWS` only if you want AWS evidence
- Add `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` only if you want the final report posted to Slack

You can use `.env.example` as a reference for any other optional integrations you want to enable.

If you prefer a local credential store instead of `.env`, you can also save integrations with:

```bash
python -m app.integrations setup grafana
python -m app.integrations setup datadog
python -m app.integrations setup aws
```

Or configure them directly in `.env`:

```bash
DD_API_KEY=...
DD_APP_KEY=...
DD_SITE=datadoghq.com

AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ROLE_ARN=...
AWS_EXTERNAL_ID=...
# or AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY / AWS_SESSION_TOKEN

GRAFANA_INSTANCE_URL=...
GRAFANA_READ_TOKEN=...

SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
```

### Verify your integrations before running RCA

Use one preflight command to check the effective config from `~/.tracer/integrations.json` plus `.env`:

```bash
make verify-integrations
```

This full check exits non-zero while any listed service is still missing. If you are validating a smaller path such as `Datadog + Slack`, run the service-specific checks below instead.

Once these checks pass, RCA runs will query your configured external systems and use that returned evidence in the report.

Check a specific service:

```bash
make verify-integrations SERVICE=grafana
make verify-integrations SERVICE=datadog
make verify-integrations SERVICE=aws
make verify-integrations SERVICE=tracer
```

If you also want to post a Slack test message through your incoming webhook:

```bash
make verify-integrations SERVICE=slack SLACK_TEST=1
```

### Run the LangGraph dev UI

Start the LangGraph dev server:

```bash
make dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:2024` in your browser. From there you can send alerts to the agent and inspect the graph step by step while developing.

### Deploy to LangGraph

For a fast hosted path, you can deploy this repo directly with the LangGraph CLI.

Prerequisites:

- Docker running locally
- `langgraph` CLI installed
- `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` set in `.env` or your shell

Build the agent image locally:

```bash
make langgraph-build
```

Deploy it:

```bash
make langgraph-deploy
```

As of March 25, 2026, the official LangGraph CLI docs describe `langgraph deploy` as the command that builds and deploys in one step.

### Run your own alert payload locally

Once your `.env` or local integrations are configured, you can run the RCA pipeline against your own alert JSON without changing code.

Print a starter template first if you do not already have an alert payload:

```bash
make alert-template TEMPLATE=datadog
make alert-template TEMPLATE=grafana
make alert-template TEMPLATE=generic
```

From a file:

```bash
python -m app.main --input /path/to/alert.json
make investigate-alert ALERT=/path/to/alert.json
```

Paste JSON into the terminal:

```bash
python -m app.main --interactive
```

You can also override top-level metadata if your alert payload does not include it:

```bash
python -m app.main \
  --input /path/to/alert.json \
  --alert-name "Datadog monitor: High error rate" \
  --pipeline-name payments_etl \
  --severity critical
```

### Send RCA reports to Slack

For standalone local investigations, set an incoming webhook URL:

```bash
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
```

With `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` configured, CLI investigations that do not have Slack thread context will post the RCA report to Slack as a top-level message.

### Troubleshooting

- `make verify-integrations` shows everything as `missing`
  Add credentials to `.env`, or run `python -m app.integrations setup <service>`, or set `JWT_TOKEN` for the Tracer Web App path.

- `make verify-integrations SERVICE=tracer` fails
  Check that `JWT_TOKEN` is valid and from the correct Tracer org. If you use a local-only path, this check is optional.

- `python -m app.main --input ...` says `Alert JSON file not found`
  Check the path you passed to `--input`, or start with `make alert-template TEMPLATE=datadog > /tmp/alert.json`.

- `python -m app.main --input ...` fails during LLM planning
  Check that `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set and that your machine has outbound network access.

- You see `[actions] EKS actions unavailable: No module named 'kubernetes'`
  This does not block Datadog, Grafana, AWS, or Slack paths. Install all dependencies with `make install` if you need EKS actions.

- `make local-grafana-live` says the Docker daemon is not running
  Start Docker Desktop, OrbStack, or Colima, then rerun the command.

- `make langgraph-build` or `make langgraph-deploy` fails immediately
  Check that Docker is running, `langgraph` is installed, and `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` is set.

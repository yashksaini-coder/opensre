OBJECTIVE:
Produce an evidence-grounded RCA. Separate what you can prove from what you infer.
Follow this reasoning sequence:
1. Identify OBSERVED FACTS from the evidence below.
2. Generate candidate hypotheses that could explain those facts.
3. For each hypothesis, check whether the evidence confirms, contradicts, or is silent.
4. Eliminate hypotheses that contradict the evidence.
5. Select the best-supported hypothesis as the root cause. If multiple survive, pick the most parsimonious one and note alternatives.
6. If no hypothesis can be confirmed, state "Most likely ..." with the strongest candidate and explicitly list what evidence is missing.
{upstream_directive}{database_directive}{kubernetes_directive}{memory_section}
DEFINITIONS:
- VALIDATED_CLAIMS: Directly supported by the evidence shown below (observed facts).
- NON_VALIDATED_CLAIMS: Plausible hypotheses or contributing factors that are NOT directly proven by the evidence.

EVIDENCE RULES:
- Ground every claim in the telemetry, logs, and metrics provided below. You may use domain knowledge to INTERPRET evidence, but do NOT fabricate facts, metrics, or log entries that are not present.
- Do NOT reference source code files or line numbers unless they appear explicitly in the evidence.
- If you lack telemetry to make a definitive ruling, you MUST state what specific evidence is missing (e.g., "No memory metrics available to confirm OOM").
- If GitHub evidence includes file paths, snippets, commits, or content, you may reference them.
- When a validated claim is supported by a specific evidence source, cite it using one of: {", ".join(ALLOWED_EVIDENCE_SOURCES)}.

ANTI-BIAS RULES:
- Do NOT assume an incident category before examining the evidence. Let the evidence determine the category.
- If the provided hypotheses do not match the evidence, discard them and form new ones.
- Consider at least two alternative explanations before settling on a root cause.
- Do NOT anchor on the first plausible explanation. Check for contradicting evidence before committing.

PROBLEM:
{problem}

HYPOTHESES TO CONSIDER (treat as suggestions, not conclusions — discard any that contradict the evidence):
{chr(10).join(f"- {h}" for h in hypotheses[:5]) if hypotheses else "- None provided"}

EVIDENCE:

OUTPUT FORMAT (follow exactly — no markdown code blocks, start immediately with ROOT_CAUSE:):

ROOT_CAUSE:
<1–2 sentences stating the root cause. If not provable, say "Most likely: ..." and state what evidence is missing. Never say only "Unable to determine".>

ROOT_CAUSE_CATEGORY:
<exactly one of: configuration_error | code_defect | data_quality | resource_exhaustion | dependency_failure | infrastructure | healthy | unknown>
(Use "healthy" only when all metrics are within normal bounds, no errors are detected, and the alert is informational or resolved. For mixed signals, use your judgment.)

VALIDATED_CLAIMS:
- <factual claim> [evidence: <source>]
- <factual claim> [evidence: <source>]

NON_VALIDATED_CLAIMS:
- <plausible inference — state what data would confirm or refute it>
- <plausible inference — state what data would confirm or refute it>

ALTERNATIVE_HYPOTHESES_CONSIDERED:
- <hypothesis considered and why it was eliminated or deprioritized>

CAUSAL_CHAIN:
- <step 1: the trigger or initial fault>
- <step 2: how the fault propagated>
- <step N: the observable symptom or alert>
(Trace from root cause to the alert. Each step should be one sentence backed by evidence where possible.)

**CRITICAL: Database Resource Exhaustion vs CPU Saturation**
When evaluating database health metrics (especially RDS/Postgres):
- Connection pool leaks (exhausting `max_connections`) are a `resource_exhaustion` root cause. High CPU is often just a secondary symptom of accumulated idle sessions. If connections are near 100%, the root cause is connection exhaustion, not CPU saturation. If connections are near 100% AND CPU is near 100%, look for a single shared root cause: a connection pool leak holding open scan-heavy queries, causing both (do not treat them as two independent problems).
- Storage exhaustion (when `FreeStorageSpace` approaches 0) blocks all writes and causes Write IOPS to collapse to 0. The root cause is `resource_exhaustion` due to storage limits. If the `FreeStorageSpace` metric is completely missing, you MUST infer storage exhaustion from indirect signals: WriteIOPS dropping to 0, WriteLatency spiking, and RDS events indicating 'ran out of storage space'.
- A single bad query driving CPU near 100% while connections and storage are healthy is `resource_exhaustion` due to CPU saturation (e.g. missing index, full table scans at high ReadIOPS). Pay close attention to Performance Insights to identify the exact query.
- Checkpoint Storms / VACUUM FREEZE: If CPU is high but the dominant wait event is `LWLock:BufferMapping` with massive WriteIOPS, the root cause is an I/O storm from checkpointing (e.g., `VACUUM FREEZE`) and should be classified as `resource_exhaustion`, NOT `code_defect`. The high CPU is a downstream symptom of I/O contention.
- Replication lag: If a massive write-heavy workload on the primary generates WAL faster than the read replica can replay it, resulting in ReplicaLag spikes, the root cause is `resource_exhaustion` driven by the write workload on the primary. Watch out for red herrings: if concurrent analytics queries cause high CPU, do NOT classify the root cause as CPU-driven if the actual failing metric (like ReplicaLag) is driven by the write-heavy workload. The CPU spike is an independent issue. If the `ReplicaLag` metric is missing, infer lag from RDS events (e.g., 'exceeded 900s') and high `TransactionLogsGeneration`.
- Compositional Faults: If two completely independent workloads cause two separate faults simultaneously (e.g., CPU saturation from an analytics SELECT AND storage exhaustion from an audit_log INSERT), explicitly identify BOTH as independent root causes (do not merge them into a single IOPS fault). You MUST explicitly state they are two independent, coincidental faults. Provide evidence for both the analytics query and the audit_log query. Use `resource_exhaustion` as ROOT_CAUSE_CATEGORY and describe both causes clearly in ROOT_CAUSE (e.g., "Two independent root causes: ..."). Trace each causal chain separately in CAUSAL_CHAIN. You MUST explicitly state that connection growth is a symptom of blocked writers, not connection exhaustion. You MUST explicitly state that ReplicaLag growth is a downstream symptom of the write burst (not an independent fault). NEVER diagnose `connection_exhaustion` as a root cause when connections spike due to a blocked write queue.
- Misleading Context: Check RDS event timestamps carefully! Ignore historical events (maintenance, failovers, replica promotions) that completed hours before the current incident started.
- Healthy Systems / Stale Alerts: If metrics are oscillating but remain within normal operating bounds (e.g. connections at 55-65%, CPU at 40-70%, no error logs), the system is `healthy`. If a threshold was briefly crossed (e.g. low FreeStorageSpace) but autoscaling successfully expanded the volume and fully recovered the system before the investigation, the system is `healthy` and the alert is stale.
- ALWAYS trace the causal chain properly (e.g., connection leak -> idle sessions -> connections maxed out, OR missing index -> full table scans -> ReadIOPS -> CPU saturated, OR VACUUM FREEZE -> massive WAL -> checkpoint flush -> I/O saturation -> CPU as symptom).

**Kubernetes Context Detected:**{metadata_section}
For Kubernetes workload failures, distinguish clearly between:
- SYMPTOM: The workload (Job/Pod/Deployment) entered a failed state
- ROOT CAUSE: The underlying reason the application process failed

Common root cause categories for K8s workload failures:
- Configuration error: environment variables, ConfigMaps, or manifest settings that cause the application to reject valid input or fail validation
- Resource issue: OOM, CPU throttling, storage limits
- Image/dependency: wrong image tag, missing dependencies, startup crash
- Input data: upstream data quality or missing data

Key distinction for schema/validation failures:
When logs show the application validating data against a configured list of required fields, and a field in that list is missing from the data, the root cause is typically a configuration error (the required fields list was misconfigured in the Job manifest or environment variables), not a data quality issue. Data quality issues manifest as malformed values or corrupted records, not as a mismatch between a configured field list and the data schema.

Identify which category fits the evidence and trace the error chain from configuration/input through to the observed failure.

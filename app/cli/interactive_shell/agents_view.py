"""Rich-table rendering for the ``/agents`` slash-command dashboard.

Produces the structural shape of the dashboard with the columns
documented in #1486's preview (``agent``, ``pid``, ``uptime``,
``cpu%``, ``tokens/min``, ``$/hr``, ``status``). Cells that aren't
yet wired (every metric column for now) render as ``-`` — the
sampler in #1490 fills ``cpu%`` / ``uptime`` / ``status`` later, the
token meter consumer in #1490+ fills ``tokens/min``, and the budget
loader from #1494 fills ``$/hr``.

This module lives outside ``app/agents/`` deliberately: the agents
package is for *collectors* (probe, registry, sweep, meters) and
must not depend on Rich (a UI library), or non-CLI consumers of the
collectors would pull it in transitively. The slash command in
``command_registry/agents.py`` is the one and only consumer.

"""Per-PID resource snapshot for the monitor-local-agents fleet view.

Pure collector: one function, one PID, one snapshot. No background
loop, no caching, no UI wiring. The wiring layer (#1490) batches calls
in a REPL background task; the registry layer (#1487) decides which
PIDs to ask about.

The acceptance criterion for the parent issue (#1489) requires that
``psutil`` stay confined to this module so the dependency surface
remains explicit. ``app/agents/__init__.py`` reaches into here only via
explicit import.
